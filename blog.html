             <h2>It is beautiful even to exist</h2>
             <p>Life, a small four lettered word with a big meaning. From childhood the constant noise of
                 make our lives better has been echoing in our ears. <span id="drop"><br /><i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></span>
                 <span class="blog1content">But what is life ? Life is the art of existing, and the best thing about
                     art is that everyone has his/her own taste. Every art is beautiful, even if there is no
                     art and just existence. Some admire the art of others, some improve their own and some paint it 
                     slowly and carefully. The beauty of this art is the subjectivity. We all start with a canvas, some
                     with a beautiful outline on it, some with a scribbled canvas. But as you know, it is the artist who
                     matters, the artist can take inspiration from others, but the final work is his, it has its own
                     originality, its own perfections and its own flaws and no mortal in this world has the right to
                     judge it. We all are artists perfect in our own ways, some leave 
                     their canvas imcomplete, some don't get the time to complete their canvas, some have a difficult time
                     in painting their canvas, some lack the colors to paint their, some share their colors with others, some 
                     like their art black and white, some like it colorful, but at the
                     end we all are artist trying to complete and perfect their arts. So stay, stay, your art is incomplete,
                     your art needs you. The universe is meant just to be seen by your eyes, how rare and beautiful it is even to
                     exist. Everything is here, just see one more time and with shortness of breath explain the infinite.<br /><br />
